This is a Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) simulation written to try different strategies for assignment and routing problems in a robotic warehouse. The project is a part of Systems Design course of METU Industrial Engineering department.

The simulation is a **work in progress**.

**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, simpy, networkx, gurobi, google or tools, pydoe3, tkinter

**Layout and Inputs:**
1. Horizontal & Vertical Ailes: Number of inner ailes.
